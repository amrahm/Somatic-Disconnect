Basic movement
	PlayerPhysics
		Use interface or abstract class, don't just override everything
		Make force on arms be mostly dispersed by arms
			Make hit analyzer based on twistrot that says where hit is and what direction it came from
		Add angular limits
			Maybe do forwardVector dotted with the parents three vectors, and set limits based on that?
				We can call tester function in hitRot
		Set maximum for hitrot
		Figure out some sort of momentum/inertia thing so arms swing around and such from spine moving around	//IMPORTANT This really completes the humany feel.
		Rotate Man itself for hip rotations?
		Make not do walk thing for static colliders when hips hit
		HitRot for the hip
		Keep over center of mass
		HitRot fixes for thigh/shin combo
		Slippin and slidin on high angle surfaces

		parent switching for aiming
		Smoothdamp between aim and not aim for gunarm.

		Hold up gun if pressed against wall.
		Hold over barrier if can see over it.
	Be on top of bumpy truck
	Crouch fixes
		Add different anim for when in air?
		allow running while crouched
	Add force down when jumping?
	Maybe get rid of crouch before jump? Maybe only when stationary?
