Suit detect laser pointer
Ricochet Gun - This gun does some futuristic bullshit to make bullets _unbelievably_ bouncy! Don't worry about the science, worry about shooting yourself!
If openworld doesn't work out, city spheres instead
FTL as late game development. Early game makes clear how limited STL travel is.
Ammo teleporter that teleports ammo from stockpile - make ammo a problem for early game and an expense for late game
	Stockpiles can be destroyed
	Teleporters for other things  (vehicles, maybe troops?) that are bigger than thing teleported and are easily destroyed
Drones, flying/rolling with weapons and such
Trippy/cool death sequence
	Dream mixed with tech representation of being uploaded conscious when starting (for tutorial) and when dying without enough money
		This will allow hacking that isn't super boring. Could still be puzzle type stuff, but with action, or parkour challenge type stuff. I dunno, be creative you fuck.
Lowest difficulty choice - "Your Mom"
Auto-adjust difficulty setting. Look into concept of "flow" in creative/leisure activities.
Wizard Mode
Throwing guns sorta like Hotline Miami/Duck Game
Can melee guns out of other peoples hands
Projected copy of yourself, for ambush/distraction

Online Ideas:
	Short RTS-like matches
	Persistent crew, vehicles, upgrades, etc., but these can all be killed/destroyed or limited for specific matches (based on the scenario)
	#YOLOmode:
		Like realistic mode (no re-spawning), but you only get a single try, which permanently ties a special additional rank/badge type thing to your account
		Has to be unlocked by reaching a certain online rank, playing online for a certain amt of time, and doing well enough in realistic mode

Name Ideas:
	First World Anarchy
	That Good Night
	The Whe
	A Thousand Deaths
	Pokemon: Fire Emblem
	Dreams of a Forgotten Tomorrow
	Quantum Age
	Somatic Disconnect	<------ (disconnecting body from mind)
	[Something], [Somethingelse], and [Anotherthing]	<------ (makes it hard to put in lists)
